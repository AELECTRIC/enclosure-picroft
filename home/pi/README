PiCroft development image, v0.5

This image provides a quick getting-started to Mycroft.  This is a Raspian
Jessie Lite with Mycroft pre-installed and configured to operate with:
  * Headphones or speaker plugged into the Pi's headphone jack
  * Generic USB microphone

If you wish audio to go out the HDMI -- e.g. if you have your Pi plugged in
to a TV and you want to use it's speaker -- you can edit the 
startup_auto_run.sh script and change the amixer to use '2' instead of '1'.

If you wish to use Wifi instead of an ethernet connection, you can run the
configure_wifi.sh script.  This will start the Mycroft wifi setup process.
You only need to do this once.


Additional commands you can use from the command line:
   cli - Starts a command line Mycroft client.  Just type instead of talking

   say - One-shot method of "saying" something to Mycroft

   view_log - Continuously displays the log of what Mycroft is hearing and
              saying to you.

   test_microphone - Performs a brief recording and playback to test that
              your equipment is functioning correctly

   msm install <repo> - Install a skill from Github, e.g.
              msm install https://github.com/ethanaward/demo_skill.git
